== zedtech

A set of scripts, automation, and toolkit that provides a way for services
and organizations to compose meaningful pipelines with minimal glue.

=== Status

Work in progress.

=== Goals

The goal of this repository is to have a simple way to share reusable parts
that our CI/CD pipeline uses in Bash, Haskell/Turtle, and other supported
_scripting_ environments.

At the moment we just have Bash function libraries but only because they were
already built and vetted.
